# mesh_shortest_path
This repository contains the source code for rough extrema estimation given a source human body point cloud/mesh. The following projects are coded in C#/C++ with the exception of some python wrappers. Note: this repository was created in respect to a research project conducted at Varian as part of an internship.

To use this repository declare the number of vertices of the given mesh/point cloud at the #define Vtx line.
